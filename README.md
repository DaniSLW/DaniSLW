### Hey there 👋

I'm Dani, a software engineer based in Romania.

I mostly work on fronted stuff and trying to learn more about backend.

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on. Everything here is build from scratch, no copy/paste templates.
